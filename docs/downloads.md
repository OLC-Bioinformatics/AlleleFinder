## Downloading profiles and alleles

Here is my workflow for downloading the profile and allele files (this assumes that you have an Enterobase account):

Navigate to [the Enterobase _Escherichia coli_ download page](https://enterobase.warwick.ac.uk/species/ecoli/download_data)

#### Download Profile
- Click `Download ST profiles for scheme` button
- Save to directory of your choice
- Extract profile from .gz archive

#### Download Alleles
- Click the `Filter/Clear Filters` button
- Select `Description` from the drop-down menu
- Enter `Shiga` in the `Contains` text box
- Click `Filter`
- Click next to the top four entries (e.g. Locus tag `ECs1205 (-)`)
- Click the `Download alleles for selected loci` button
- Save the files to the directory of your choice
- Extract alleles from .gz archives
